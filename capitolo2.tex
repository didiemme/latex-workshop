\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Hierarchical Procruste Matching} 
\label{algHPM}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Initialize: match $X$ and $Y$ using GPM
\FOR { segment lengths: $l$ = $50$, $25$, $12.5$ }
\FOR { segments of $X$: $m$ = $1$, $\dots$, \# segs. at len. $l$ }
\STATE Compute the \textsl{predicted match} of seg. $m$ based on the matches at length $l-1$
\STATE Define neighborhood around the \textsl{predicted match}
\STATE Compute PD between seg. $m$ and each neighborhood seg. of $Y$
\ENDFOR
\STATE Select matches and get total score for len. $l$ based on PD between segs. and candidate matches
\ENDFOR
\STATE shape similarity = wtd. sum of scores at each length
